          PerfKitBenchmarker is an open source benchmarking tool used to
          measure and compare cloud offerings. It is a joint community effort
          from over 500 participants on GitHub across researchers, academic
          institutions and industry companies, which is led by Google.
          PerfKitBenchmarker reduces the complexity in running benchmarks on
          supported cloud providers by unified and simple commands.
          PerfKitBenchmarker measures the end to end time to provision
          resources in the cloud, in addition to reporting on the most standard
          metrics of peak performance, e.g.: latency, throughput,
          time-to-complete, IOPS. PerfKitBenchmarker currently supports eight
          cloud providers: Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services,
          DigitalOcean, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, Kubernetes, OpenStack, AliCloud and
          local environment.
